# Hide Members Only Videos on YouTube
Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/hide-members-only-videos/

## How to Use
You can install the Firefox extension from this [link](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/hide-members-only-videos/) or by downloading the extension and installing it locally.

I haven't uploaded the Chrome version to the store so you will have to download and extract the folder, enable developer mode in Chrome, and click 'Load unpacked extension' under the extensions tab. If you are confused by this process, there are tutorials online on how to install local extensions you can follow.

I take no responsiblity for any user error during the installation process.
