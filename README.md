# Hide Members Only Videos on YouTube
Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/hide-members-only-videos/

## How to Use
You can install the Firefox extension from this [link](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/hide-members-only-videos/) or by downloading the folder and installing it locally.

I haven't uploaded the Chrome version to the store so you will have to download the folder, enable developer mode in Chrome, and click 'Load unpacked extension' under the extensions tab.
